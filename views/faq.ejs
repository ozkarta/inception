                        <div class="answer"><img src="images/answer.svg">Yes, ratings are anonymous. Even though you are signing in, it will not display any of your personal information once you post your rating.</div>

                        <div class="answer"><img src="images/answer.svg">
                            We want to make sure that is a real person who is adding the manager.  When rating someone, it simply helps us to try to maintain an accurate score of the Leaders and Bosses; if everyone could easily vote without signing in, it would skew the average.</div>

                        <div class="question"><img src="images/question.svg">Would my manager be contacted if I add them using the Linkedin or company email?</div>
                        <div class="answer"><img src="images/answer.svg">Absolutely No! The reason we are asking for their Linkedin account is to help maintain accurate information and making sure the person is not added multiple times into our database. The company email is simply just in case your manager doesnâ€™t have a Linkedin account, and he or she would not be contacted at all.</div>
